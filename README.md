# Design and Development
## Who am I, and how can I help you?

I am a web developer with 2 years of experience. I've completed several projects and small fixes for my clients, achieving a 90% satisfaction rate. My expertise primarily lies in front-end development, but I am also confident in my back-end development skills. Some of the skills I have mastered include:

HTML & CSS
JavaScript
React
jQuery
PHP
Bootstrap
Node.js
npm
Express.js
SQL
I am also proficient in using several website builders, such as:

Wix
WordPress
Webflow
Yola

## Work and Availability

I am comfortable working in any time zone. I primarily offer project-based contracts and am also open to hourly rate contracts. An invoice will be sent when the contract is signed. You will have access to the product and codebase throughout the project, allowing you to monitor progress and quality.

Time tracking and invoicing are managed via Upwork Direct Contracts, ensuring a simple, straightforward, and secure process. This protects your money at each stage while assuring me of payment completion.
